# multiarch-ci-provisioner
The RedHat Multi-Arch QE provisioner project is an effort to provide Jenkins CI users with an easy way build and test packages across all architectures. It is meant to go hand in hand with the multiarch-test-template project so that users can get up and running with their tests quickly. Currently this project is only expected to work in RedHat's internal enviroment, we are making active progress towards supporting general usage.
